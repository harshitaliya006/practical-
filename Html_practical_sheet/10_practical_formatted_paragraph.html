    elements are thr building bolcks of HTML pages. With constructs, images and other objects such as
    interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered pag. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
    by denoting structural semantics for text such as <b> headings, paragraph, lists, links, quotes and ohter
        items.</b> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using <u> angle brackets.</u> Tags such as
    <span style="color: green;"> &#60; img &#62;</span> and <span style="color: green;">&#60;input &#62;</span>
    directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as < p>
        surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
